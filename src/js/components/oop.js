Object Oriented Programming

/**
====================================
Object Oriented Programming:

The basic idea of OOP is that we use objects to model real world things that we want to represent inside our programs, and/or provide a simple way to access functionality that would otherwise be hard or impossible to make use of.

Objects can contain related data and code, which represent information about the thing you are trying to model, and functionality or behavior that you want it to have. 

Object data (and often, functions too) can be stored neatly (the official word is encapsulated) inside an object package (which can be given a specific name to refer to, which is sometimes called a namespace), making it easy to structure and access; objects are also commonly used as data stores that can be easily sent across the network.

** Abstraction â€” creating a simple model of a more complex thing, which represents its most important aspects in a way that is easy to work with for our program's purposes.

/**
====================================
Example: Factory Functions

  - This function makes and returns an object every time it is called.
  - The resulting objects all follow the same "recipe".
*/

function makeColor(r, g, b) {
	const color = {};
	// our 3 unique properties added to the "color" object
	color.r = r;
	color.g = g;
	color.b = b;

	color.rgb = function() {
		// destructure "r, g, b" to "this" which is referring to the makeColor() object
		const { r, g, b } = this;

		return `rbg(${r}, ${g}, ${b})`;
	};

	color.hex = function() {
		// "this" is referring to the makeColor() object again
		const { r, g, b } = this;

		return (
			"#" + ((1 << 24) + (r << 16) + (g << 8) + b).toString(16).slice(1)
		);
	};

	return color;
}

const firstColor = makeColor(35, 255, 150);

firstColor.rgb(); // -> "rbg(35, 255, 150)"
firstColor.hex(); // -> "#23ff96"

/**
 Factory functions are not commonly used because of their shortcomings:

 Every time we make a new color object we start with an empty object. We have our 3 unique properties (color.r, color.g, color.b) that are added to the color object.

 But then our 2 functions (color.rgb, color.hex) are recreated and a unique copy is added to each color object. So in other words, each color object has it's own rgb/hex function. But there's no reason to have a unique copy of the function itself.
 */

// Let's look at an example of this taken from the previous example code:
const whiteColor = makeColor(255, 255, 255);
whiteColor.hex(); // -> "#ffffff"
whiteColor.rgb(); // -> "rbg(255, 255, 255)"

const blackColor = makeColor(0, 0, 0);
blackColor.hex(); // -> "#000000"
blackColor.rgb(); // -> "rbg(0, 0, 0)"

// the example below is checking to see if both whiteColor and blackColor are referring to the same "hex" function. We see that they are not, "whiteColor" and "blackColor" have their own separate copy of the "hex" function.
whiteColor.hex === blackColor.hex; // -> false

// if we try this on the built-in methods for strings and arrays they are both referencing the same function. They don't each have their own copy of "slice" and "pop".
"hi".slice === "bye".slice; // -> true
[ 1, 2, 3 ].pop === [ 4, 5, 6 ].pop; // -> true

// This is where constructor function's come in.

/**
====================================
Example: Constructor Functions

A constructor function is a function that helps us create objects. 
*/

// Demo 1:
function Color(r, g, b) {
	this.r = r;
	this.g = g;
	this.b = b;
}
Color(255, 255, 255); // -> undefined

// Demo 2:
function Color(r, g, b) {
	this.r = r;
	this.g = g;
	this.b = b;
	// in this case "this" will refer to the global scope, the nearest object which is the "Window" object
	console.log(this); // -> Window
}
Color(255, 255, 255);

// ** with constructor functions we generally capitalize the name of the function to symbolize that it is a constructor function.

/** 
====================================
The "new" operator:

 * The "new" operator lets developers create an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types that has a constructor function.
*/

// Syntax:
new constructor[[ arguments ]]();

// ** The "new" operator under the hood:

// Demo
function Color(r, g, b) {
	this.r = r;
	this.g = g;
	this.b = b;
	console.log(this); // -> Object { r: 255, g: 40, b: 100 }
}

new Color(255, 40, 100);

/*
When we call the "Color" function with "new" and pass in values it's going to do certain things behind the scenes.

First:
  1. Creates a blank, plain JavaScript object.

Next:
  2. Adds a property to the new object (__proto__) that links to the constructor function's prototype object. 
    - Note: Properties/objects added to the construction function prototype are therefore accessible to all instances created from the constructor function (using new).

Next:
  3. Binds the newly created object instance as the this context (i.e. all references to this in the constructor function now refer to the object created in the first step).

Lastly:
  4. Returns this if the function doesn't return an object.
*/

// so behind the scenes, it really looks something like this:
function Color(r, g, b) {
	const newObj = {}; // (*1*) the "new" operator creates an object

	// (*3*) "this" is bound to "newObj" so here we're adding r,g,b to the "newObj" object.
	this.r = r;
	this.g = g;
	this.b = b;

	return newObj; // (*4*) the "new" operator returns "this" which is referring to "newObj"
}

// ** if we don't use the "new" keyword, "this" will refer to the window object.

// Example 1:
function Color(r, g, b) {
	this.r = r;
	this.g = g;
	this.b = b;
}

// instead of defining our functions inside the Color function, we add them to the Color.prototype outside the initial Color function call

// ** we don't want to use arrow functions for these since they behave differently with "this"

// here we add an "rgb" function method to the "Color" prototype
Color.prototype.rgb = function() {
	const { r, g, b } = this;
	return `rgb(${r}, ${g}, ${b})`;
};

// here we add an "hex" function method to the "Color" prototype
Color.prototype.hex = function() {
	const { r, g, b } = this;
	return "#" + ((1 << 24) + (r << 16) + (g << 8) + b).toString(16).slice(1);
};

// here we add an "rgba" function method to the "Color" prototype
Color.prototype.rgba = function(a = 1.0) {
	const { r, g, b } = this;
	return `rgba(${r}, ${g}, ${b}, ${a})`;
};

// now we have access to those Color prototype functions globally.

const color1 = new Color(255, 255, 255);
const color2 = new Color(0, 0, 0);

color1.rgb === color2.rgb; // -> true
color1.hex === color2.hex; // -> true

color1.rgb() === color2.rgb(); // -> false
color1.hex() === color2.hex(); // -> false

document.body.style.backgroundColor = color1.rgba();
