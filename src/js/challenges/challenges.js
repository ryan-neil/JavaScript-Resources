==========================================
Function Challenge 1: Password Validator
==========================================
- Write a isValidPassword function that accepts 2 arguments: password and username.
- Password must:
	* be at least 8 characters
	* cannot contain spaces
	* cannot contain the username
- If all requirements are met, return true
- Otherwise: false
*/

==========================================
Function Challenge 2: Average of an Array
==========================================
- Write a function to find the average value in an array of numbers.

let testScores = [ 86, 92, 78, 82 ];
*/

/*
==========================================
Function Challenge 3: Pangrams
==========================================
- A pangram is a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet, like:
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

- Write a function called isPangram, which checks to see if a given sentence contains every letter of the alphabet. Make sure you ignore string casing.

==========================================
Function Challenge 4: Get Playing Card
==========================================
- Write a getCard() function which returns a random playing card object, like:

{
	value: 'K'
	suit: 'clubs'
}

- Pick a random value from:
2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A
- Pick a random suit from:
'clubs', 'spades', 'hearts', 'diamonds'
- Return both in an object

==========================================
Looping Challenge 1: Looping a Triangle
==========================================

- Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
*/

/* 
==========================================
Looping Challenge 2: FizzBuzz
==========================================
- Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 0 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

- When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
*/

/* 
==========================================
Looping Challenge 3: Chessboard
==========================================
- Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8x8 grid, using "newline" characters tom separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a # character. The characters should form a chessboard.

- Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #

Function Challenge 1: Minimum
==========================================
- Write a function 'min' that takes two arguments and returns their minimum.
*/

/* 
==========================================
Function Challenge 2: Recursion
==========================================
- Define a recursive function 'isEven' corresponding to this description. The function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and return a Boolean.
- Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a way to fix this?
*/

/* 
==========================================
Function Challenge 3: Bean Counting
==========================================
- Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only arguments and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase "B" characters there are in the string.
- Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase "B" characters). Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.
*/

/* 
==========================================
Data Structures: Objects and Arrays Challenge 1: 
The Sum of a Range
==========================================
- Write a 'range' function that takes two arguments, 'start' and 'end', and returns an array containing all the numbers from 'start' up to (and including) 'end'.
- Next write a 'sum' function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of these numbers. Run the example program and whether it does indeed return 55.
*/

/* 
==========================================
Data Structures: Objects and Arrays Challenge 2: 
Reversing an array
==========================================
- Write 2 functions, 'reverseArray' and 'reverseArrayInPlace'.
	* The first, 'reverseArray', takes an array as argument and produces a new array that has the same elements in the inverse order.
	* The Second, 'reverseArrayInPlace', does what the reverse method does: it modifies the array given as argument by reversing its elements. 
	* Neither may use the standard reverse method.
