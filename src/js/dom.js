The Document Object Model

/*
====================================
The Dom
====================================
- This is, fundamentally, connecting JavaScript to HTML and CSS.
- It's our JavaScript window into the contents of a webpage.
- It's just a bunch of objects that we can interact with via JavaScript.
- It is the JavaScript representation of the content on a page and it consists of a bunch of JavaScript objects.
*/

/*
====================================
Document
====================================
 - The document object is our entry point into the world of the DOM. It contains representations of all the content on a page, plus tons of useful methods and properties.
 - Document is the root of the entire webpage. It's in every browser window we open (<!document html>).
 - All of the other pieces of the DOM are located within the "document" object.
